      <h5>Introduction to LLM</h5>
      <p>Difference between LLM and NLP:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LLMs are trained on vast quantities of text data. This large-scale training allows LLMs to capture deeper contextual information and subtleties of human language compared to previous approaches. As a result, LLMs have significantly improved performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, including text translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and many more.</li>
        <li>Earlier NLP models were typically designed for specific tasks, such as text categorization, language translation, etc. While those earlier NLP models excelled in their narrow applications, LLMs demonstrate a broader proficiency across a wide range of NLP tasks.</li>
      </ul>
