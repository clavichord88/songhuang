    <h2>Virtual Private Network</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h2>VPN</h2>
      <p>A virtual private network (VPN) uses an encrypted tunnel within another network. VPNs are typically deployed to connect two or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (typically the public internet). Traffic is encrypted while traveling over the untrusted network to prevent eavesdropping or other attacks. VPNs can enable networks to safely and securely share sensitive information.</p> 
      <h5>VPN Gateway</h5>
      <p> VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of the virtual network and enable the following connectivity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.</li>
        <li>Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.</li>
        <li>Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All data transfer is encrypted inside a private tunnel as it crosses the internet. You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network. However, you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.</p>
      <p>When setting up a VPN gateway, you must specify the type of VPN - either policy-based or route-based. The primary distinction between these two types is how they determine which traffic needs encryption. In Azure, regardless of the VPN type, the method of authentication employed is a preshared key.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Policy-based VPN gateways specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel. This type of device evaluates every data packet against those sets of IP addresses to choose the tunnel where that packet is going to be sent through.</li>
        <li>In Route-based gateways, IPSec tunnels are modeled as a network interface or virtual tunnel interface. IP routing (either static routes or dynamic routing protocols) decides which one of these tunnel interfaces to use when sending each packet. Route-based VPNs are the preferred connection method for on-premises devices. They're more resilient to topology changes such as the creation of new subnets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use a route-based VPN gateway if you need any of the following types of connectivity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connections between virtual networks</li>
        <li>Point-to-site connections</li>
        <li>Multisite connections</li>
        <li>Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>High-availability scenarios</h2>
      <h5>Active/standby</h5>
      <p>By default, VPN gateways are deployed as two instances in an active/standby configuration, even if you only see one VPN gateway resource in Azure. When planned maintenance or unplanned disruption affects the active instance, the standby instance automatically assumes responsibility for connections without any user intervention. Connections are interrupted during this failover, but they typically restore within a few seconds for planned maintenance and within 90 seconds for unplanned disruptions.</p>
      <h5>Active/active</h5>
      <p>With the introduction of support for the BGP routing protocol, you can also deploy VPN gateways in an active/active configuration. In this configuration, you assign a unique public IP address to each instance. You then create separate tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address. You can extend the high availability by deploying an additional VPN device on-premises.</p>
      <h5>ExpressRoute failover</h5>
      <p>Another high-availability option is to configure a VPN gateway as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections. ExpressRoute circuits have resiliency built in. However, they aren't immune to physical problems that affect the cables delivering connectivity or outages that affect the complete ExpressRoute location. In high-availability scenarios, where there's risk associated with an outage of an ExpressRoute circuit, you can also provision a VPN gateway that uses the internet as an alternative method of connectivity. In this way, you can ensure there's always a connection to the virtual networks.</p>
      <h5>Zone-redundant gateways</h5>
      <p>In regions that support availability zones, VPN gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a zone-redundant configuration. This configuration brings resiliency, scalability, and higher availability to virtual network gateways. Deploying gateways in Azure availability zones physically and logically separates gateways within a region while protecting your on-premises network connectivity to Azure from zone-level failures. These gateways require different gateway stock keeping units (SKUs) and use Standard public IP addresses instead of Basic public IP addresses.</p>
      <h2>ExpressRoute</h2>
      <p>Azure ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection, with the help of a connectivity provider. This connection is called an ExpressRoute Circuit. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. onnectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet. This setup allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.</p>
      <h5>Features and benefits of ExpressRoute</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions in the geopolitical region.</li>
        <li>Global connectivity to Microsoft services across all regions with the ExpressRoute Global Reach.</li>
        <li>Dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).</li>
        <li>Built-in redundancy in every peering location for higher reliability.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Global Connectivity</h5>
      <p>You can enable ExpressRoute Global Reach to exchange data across your on-premises sites by connecting your ExpressRoute circuits.</p>
      <h5>Dynamic Routing</h5>
      <p>ExpressRoute uses the BGP. BGP is used to exchange routes between on-premises networks and resources running in Azure. This protocol enables dynamic routing between your on-premises network and services running in the Microsoft cloud.
      </p>
      <h5>Built-in redundancy</h5>
      <p>Each connectivity provider uses redundant devices to ensure that connections established with Microsoft are highly available. You can configure multiple circuits to complement this feature.</p>
      <h5>ExpressRoute connectivity models</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>CloudExchange colocation: Colocation refers to your datacenter, office, or other facility being physically colocated at a cloud exchange, such as an ISP. If your facility is colocated at a cloud exchange, you can request a virtual cross-connect to the Microsoft cloud.</li>
        <li>Point-to-point Ethernet connection: using a point-to-point connection to connect your facility to the Microsoft cloud.</li>
        <li>With any-to-any connectivity, you can integrate your wide area network (WAN) with Azure by providing connections to your offices and datacenters. Azure integrates with your WAN connection to provide a connection like you would have between your datacenter and any branch offices.</li>
        <li>You can connect directly into the Microsoft's global network at a peering location strategically distributed across the world. ExpressRoute Direct provides dual 100 Gbps or 10-Gbps connectivity, which supports Active/Active connectivity at scale.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>DNS</h2>
      <p>Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Azure DNS uses the scope and scale of Microsoft Azure to provide numerous benefits, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DNS domains in Azure DNS are hosted on Azure's global network of DNS name servers, providing resiliency and high availability. Azure DNS uses anycast networking, so the closest available DNS server answers each DNS query, providing fast performance and high availability for your domain.</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Ease of Use</li>
        <li>Customizable virtual networks</li>
        <li>Alias records</li>
      </ul>
