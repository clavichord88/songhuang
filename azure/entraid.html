    <h2>Entra ID</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <p>Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based IAM service from Microsoft. It helps organizations manage and secure identities and control access to applications, both on-premises and in the cloud. </p>
      <p>One of the most significant advantages of using Microsoft Entra ID is its ability to centralize identity management. Entra ID simplifies this by providing a single platform to manage all user identities and their access rights. Centralized identity management means that all user accounts, groups, and roles are managed from a single location. This centralization offers several benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplified administration: Administrators can manage user identities, assign roles, and set access permissions from one interface. This reduces the complexity and time required to manage these tasks.</li>
        <li>Consistency: Centralized  management ensures that security policies and access controls are applied uniformly across the organization. This reduces the risk of security gaps that can occur when policies are inconsistently applied.</li>
        <li>Efficiency: With a single source of truth for identity management, processes such as onboarding new employees, managing access requests, and auditing user activity become more streamlined and efficient.</li>
      </ul>
