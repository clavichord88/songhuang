      <h2>Azure Virtual Machines</h2>
      <p>With Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), you can create and use VMs in the cloud. VMs provide infrastructure as a service (IaaS) in the form of a virtualized server and can be used in many ways. As an IaaS offering, you still need to configure, update, and maintain the software that runs on the VM. You can run single VMs for testing, development, or minor tasks. Or you can group VMs together to provide high availability, scalability, and redundancy. Azure can also manage the grouping of VMs for you with features such as scale sets and availability sets.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs. Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand, or you can set it to scale based on a defined schedule. Virtual machine scale sets also automatically deploy a load balancer to make sure that your resources are being used efficiently. With virtual machine scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.</li>
        <li>Virtual machine availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure. Availability accomplish these objectives by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain.
          <ul>
            <li>Update domain: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.</li>
            <li>Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set splits your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h2>Azure virtual desktop</h2>
      <p>Another type of virtual machine is the Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enhance security: Azure Virtual Desktop provides centralized security management for users' desktops with Microsoft Entra ID. You can enable multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins. You can also secure access to data by assigning granular role-based access controls (RBACs) to users.

        With Azure Virtual Desktop, the data and apps are separated from the local hardware. The actual desktop and apps are running in the cloud, meaning the risk of confidential data being left on a personal device is reduced. Additionally, user sessions are isolated in both single and multi-session environments.
        </li>
        <li>
        Azure Virtual Desktop lets you use Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, the only Windows client-based operating system that enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM. Azure Virtual Desktop also provides a more consistent experience with broader application support compared to Windows Server-based operating systems.
        </li>
